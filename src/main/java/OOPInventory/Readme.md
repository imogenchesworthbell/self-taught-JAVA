- **Classes** are a template to create new items and every new item that we make is called an **object**.


- **Objects** need attributes, e.g. name, quantity


- **Private** means they can't be directly accessed outside the current class, we have to use getter methods and setter methods to access and modify these, this is **encapsulation**.
